PROJECT TITLE: Project 1-1: PENTOMINOES
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Create an algorithm that fills a grid with selected pentominoes as quickly and efficiently as possible if there is a solution.
VERSION or DATE: 07.10.2021
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Open the zip file and run the /PentominoTemplateBasicSearchWithGaps/PentominoTemplateBasicSearchWithGaps/src/Search.java file. Enjoy.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: 
Make sure you have the latest version of Java installed. Start the program. Select the mode to run the program. 
Mode 1 is selecting the size of the grid. Mode 2 is selecting the pentominoes. 
Select the size of the grid or the pentominoes from the List of possible ones (e.g. P,T,I,L,N,etc.). 
Press enter. Wait for the program to finish running. 
If there is a solution, you will see the pentominoes filled into the Grid at the User interface and the terminal will read: "Solution found".
If no solution can be found the Grid of the User interface will stay empty and the terminal will read: "Solution not found".
